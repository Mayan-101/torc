What has been done
1. Parameters can be entered, Error logic
2. Phase 1 questions (1, 2, 3*, 4*)
3. Market based on Random Walk
4. Redo-ing changes in parameters after launch 
5. Video-Embeds for explainers (for now the source is Youtube)


Changes to be made:
1. Graphs are unrealistic change it from a sliding window to a stacking graph
2. Algorithm in the market simulation, I need to add Unit economics of the products to giet a better estimate of the losses
3. Phase 2 & 3 , need to implement Investor logic and features like loans
